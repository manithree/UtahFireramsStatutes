# UtahFireramsStatutes

The rust part downloads the specified statues in rtf, xml, or pdf. It can also
generate a combined odt file from rtf files, but that's now deprecated.

The new groovy script takes xml formatted statutes (usually downloaded by the
rust part), and generates an odt file with a talbe of contents. This document
needs to be opened in libreoffice and the TOC generated, before it's suitable
for uploading.

[Here's a sample of the finished product.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Anse2TZuIZHRj9gx5BgNwZsWpsN0HVHdc_xZq5mesJY/edit?usp=sharing)
